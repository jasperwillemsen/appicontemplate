# App icon template
> While there are quite some templates out there already, none of the free ones seemed to fit my needs. 

### Usage
1. Open the Symbols page and place your design in the ‘icon-template’  symbol.
2. Press ‘CMD’+ ‘Shift’ + ‘E’ and select the sizes to export.

- To create an Android specific app icon make use of the ‘icon-template-alternate’. 

### Updates
All feedback is welcome and I’ll be improving and adding to the file.
